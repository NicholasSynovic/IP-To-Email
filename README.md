## About
This code is meant to quickly send the IP address of a Linux machine to any email address.

---
## Use Case
This is a utility script that is meant to be run at boot on a headless Linux machine.

---
## Installation Instructions
This script requires  >= Python 3.7.x. Just configure the script to be run at boot.

## Project Inspiration
This project came into being because I couldn't set a static IP address to a Raspberry Pi that was never connected to a monitor.
